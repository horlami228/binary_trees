# Binary Trees
## This repository contains all my works for Binary Trees in C language

A Binary tree is a heirachical data structure in computer science, it is has a non linear arrangement of nodes different from linked list and arrays which are squentially arranged. We have a root node with branches left and right as children or subtree

## There are common types of Binary trees
* > General trees 
* > Binary trees
* > Binary Search Trees
* > Complete binary tree
* > Full binary tree
* > Perfect binary tree
* > Balanced binary tree

## The different traversal method for binary trees are
* In-order traversal - left->root->right
* Pre-order traversal - root->left->right
* Post-order traversal - left->right->root

### This terminology we here everything when working with Binary trees

1. #### Depth: Which stands for the count of paths down to the selected nodes from the root node or levels which starts from 0

2. #### Height: The the longest path to a leaf node starting from 0

3. #### Size: The total number of the nodes in the tree including all internal nodes with leaf nodes.



### When talking about time complexity of  Binary tree to a linked list.

When we make use of a Blanced binary search tree the average case time can be reduced to O(log n) for operations like insertion, deletion and searching. This is compared to the O(n) for Linked list in the best and worst case. If the tree becomes balanced it can reduce the time to O(n) so its important to keep it balanced to achieve utmost performance.
